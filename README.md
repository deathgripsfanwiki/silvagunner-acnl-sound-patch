# Installation

To install, simply make a folder called "titles" in /luma/ if it doesn't already exist.

Then, create another folder with the name as the Title ID of the region of your game. (find these at http://www.3dsdb.com)

Copy the contents of the downloaded .7z file to the folder you just made.

Next, enable "Luma Patching" in the Luma Settings, hold start at boot to go to the settings menu.

That's it!
