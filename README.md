# Installation

To install, simply make a folder called "titles" in /luma/ if it doesn't already exist.

Then, create a folder inside of /luma/titles named as the Title ID of the region of your game.

You can find the Title ID [here](http://www.3dsdb.com).

Copy the contents of the downloaded .7z file to the folder you just made.

Next, enable "Luma Patching" in the Luma Settings, hold start at boot to go to the settings menu.

That's it!
